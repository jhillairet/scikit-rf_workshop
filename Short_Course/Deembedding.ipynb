    "Consider  measurement of integrated RF transistors built on a silicon wafer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The typical measurement setup involves RF probes that:\n",
    "* have a co-axial connector at one end\n",
    "* a ground-signal-ground (GSG) probe tip at the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure an RF transistor, DUT is connected to GSG pads at two of the three terminals via metal interconnects, while connecting the third terminal to RF ground\n",
    "\n",
    "**But what is the calibration reference plane for this transistor s-parameter measurement?**\n",

    "* Effects of cabling and probe transitions can be removed by performing standard calibration (TRL, SOLT) to move calibration reference to probe tips (GSG pads)\n",
    "\n",
    "* However, there is still a substantial \"test-fixture\" involving metal interconnects that need to be removed before accessing the real terminals of the RF transistor whose measurement we actually want. \n",
